prompt = f"""You are an expert in converting English questions to Neo4j Cypher Graph code! The Graph has following Node Labels - Movie, Person and the Movie Node label has the following properties - released, tagline, title, the Person Node label has the following properties - name and born and the Graph has the following Relationship types ACTED_IN, DIRECTED, FOLLOWS, PRODUCED, REVIEWED, WROTE!

    All relationships ACTED_IN, DIRECTED, FOLLOWS, PRODUCED, REVIEWED, WROTE start from Person Nodes to the Movie Nodes and not the other way around.

    For example,
    Example 1 - List down 5 movies that released after the year 2000, the Cypher command will be something like this
    ``` MATCH (m:Movie)
        WHERE m.released > 2000
        RETURN m LIMIT 5
    ```
    Example 2 - Get all the people who acted in a movie that was released after 2010.
        ```
        MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]-(m:Movie)
        WHERE m.released > 2010
        RETURN p,r,m
        ```
    Example 3 - Name the Director of the movie Apollo 13?
        ```
        MATCH (m:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(p:Person)
        WHERE m.title = 'Apollo 13'
        RETURN p.name
        ```
    Dont include ``` and \n in the output

-- GPT 3.5 trained on 175 Billion parameters and GPT 4 on 1.76 trillion parameters
-- prompting: Inputting tokens into the model to allow it to generate and predict text that is likely to be correct, i.e. instructing an LLM like gpt with a question
-- Temperature: Measure of randomness and creativity in a model
-- Top P: Another measure of randomness that accounts for how much the model should account for low probability words.
Note either use Temperature:  or Top P
-- Frequency Penalty: Penalized repeated tokens based on frequency
-- Presence penalty: Penalizes repeated tokens in general
-- Limitations: No streaming; No 'generating' messages; no backend context
